# Weather Icons SVG Bundle

This small node application will take in a set of svg files from (./svg), and create a single `<svg>` with each individual svg as a `<symbol>`.
This allows to avoid inlining every svg, and we can make use of the `<use>` instead.

## How to use this application

This node program will read from ./svg, and generate a file in ./src/assets/svg/

## Getting Started

### Installing

Use yarn or npm to install the package dependancies:

```

yarn
